# DerpWorks
============

This plugin adds helpful machines for players making structures in survival.

1. Place a dispenser and put blocks inside.
2. Place a Sea Lantern on top of the dispenser.
3. Right-click the Sea Lantern. The dispenser will place the blocks in a line, up to 512 blocks long.

If you want to change the orientation of the placed block, put that block on top of the Sea Lantern in the orientation you want.

Placing the dispenser facing up or down will also work.
